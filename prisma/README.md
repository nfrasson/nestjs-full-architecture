# Project Infrastructure Maintenance Guide

## Overview

This file guides you how to maintain and update database migrations.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- You should have access to the project's repository and the database.

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` in the project directory to install the necessary dependencies, including Prisma.

## Working with Prisma Migrations

Prisma Migrations is a powerful tool that helps you evolve your database schema in a controlled and predictable way.

### Creating a New Migration

When you modify the Prisma schema file, you'll need to create a new migration:

- Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name` to create a new migration. Replace `your_migration_name` with a descriptive name for your migration.
- This command will update your database schema and create a new SQL migration file in the `prisma/migrations` folder.

### Applying Migrations in Development

- To apply migrations locally, use `npx prisma migrate dev`. This command will apply any pending migrations on the local database instance.

### Deploying Migrations to Production

- For production, use `npx prisma migrate deploy`. It's recommended to do this in your CI/CD pipeline.
- This command applies all pending migrations in the order they were created.

## Best Practices for Migration

- **Review Migrations Before Applying:** Always review the generated SQL migration file before applying it, especially when making complex changes.
- **Use Descriptive Names:** When creating migrations, use descriptive names to make it easier to understand the changes made.
- **Version Control:** All migration files should be committed to your version control system.
- **Testing:** Test migrations in a development or staging environment before applying them to production.

## Troubleshooting

- If a migration fails, Prisma will try to rollback the changes. Check the error message for details.
- For complex schema changes, consider breaking them down into smaller, incremental migrations.

## Updating Prisma

- To update Prisma to the latest version, run `npm install @prisma/client@latest prisma@latest`.
